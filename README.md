# Unlucky Tickets Generator ðŸŽ«

In a childhood I had a lot of public transport adventures and of course it was fun to do some sum to find out if you
have a lucky ticket or not.

And in case you do not have a lucky ticket, you try to do some other mathematical operations on both sides to find a
common value.

I was always interested to know how many really unlucky tickets there are and how to calculate them.

Out of curiosity this simple project was created. The [post about it](https://habr.com/ru/articles/312920/) got 17K+
views on the popular tech resource Habrahabr. ðŸš€ðŸ‘€

## How to Run

Run the following command to print all tickets to standard output

```shell
./gradlew run
```
